## Introduction

The International Space Station (ISS) is a busy place, with astronauts visiting for several months and then coming back to Earth. By using this resource you will learn how to create a gadget that tells you how many people are living on the ISS.

### What you will learn

- What APIs are, and how they can be used to provide data services to users and developers
- What JSON is, and how it can be used to exchange data between languages and applications
- How to access a web API using the Python `requests` module
- How to use the Python REPL in IDLE to inspect and explore objects
- How to use the dictionary and list data structures in Python
- How to use GPIO Zero to control LEDs

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
- [Engage and share with the digital making community](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/community-and-sharing/creator)
